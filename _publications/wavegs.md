<b>Abstract:</b>

Modeling surface reflectance is central to connecting optical theory with real-world rendering and fabrication. While analytic BRDFs remain standard in rendering, recent advances in geometric and wave optics have expanded the design space for complex reflectance effects. However, existing waveoptics-based methods are limited to controlling reflectance intensity only, lacking the ability to design full-spectrum color-dependent BRDFs. In this work, we present the first method for designing and fabricating color BRDFs using a fully differentiable wave optics framework. Our differentiable and memory-efficient simulation framework supports end-to-end optimization of microstructured surfaces under scalar diffraction theory, enabling joint control over both angular intensity and spectral color of reflectance. We leverage grayscale lithography with a feature size of 1.5–2.0 𝜇m to fabricate 15 BRDFs spanning four representative categories: anti-mirrors, pictorial
reflections, structural colors, and iridescences. Compared to prior work, our approach achieves significantly higher fidelity and broader design flexibility, producing physically accurate and visually compelling results. By providing a practical and extensible solution for full-color BRDF design and fabrication, our method opens up new opportunities in structural coloration, product design, security printing, and advanced manufacturing.
